snappy (v0.1.0)
======

`snappy` is short for **s**ocial **n**etwork **a**nalysis in **py**thon. There are many python packages for acquiring data from social media. (`snappy` uses many of them, in fact.) There are python packages for analyzing and modeling social networks. There are many python packages for visualizing the types of data commonly acquired from social media. There is, however, no package that links the acquisition, analysis and modeling, and visualization of data from social media for doing computational social science. 

`snappy` provides a single interface for analyzing social networks, from individual users to global behavior, to allow researchers to (i) exchange models more readily, and (ii) concentrate on the scientific aspect of computational social science rather than the computational side.
